## add
 Adds a given duration to the current duration                                                                                          |

## getByFormat
 Gets the current duration in the given format `DO NOT USE THIS AS IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY`                                            |
This function sets the GlideDateTime object with a number of epoc
milliseconds onthe total duration millisends and returns that. This
causes odd results;

```js
var days = 3;
var hours = days * 24;
var minutes = hours * 60;
var seconds = minutes * 60;
var mSeconds = seconds * 1000; //259,200,000 milliseconds === 3 days
var durDelta = new GlideDuration(mSeconds); //Exactly 3 days worth of milliseconds
gs.print(durDelta.getByFormat('dd hh:mm'));//Prints "04 12:00" Expected Output would be "03 00:00"
```

## getDayPart
 Gets the number of days                                                                                                                |
## getDisplayValue
 Gets the display value of the duration in number of days, hours, and minutes                                                           |
## getDurationValue
 Gets the duration value in d HH:mm:ss format                                                                                           |
## getRoundedDayPart
 Gets the rounded number of days. If the time part is more than 12 hours, the return value is rounded up. Otherwise, it is rounded down |
## getValue
 Gets internal value of the this duration object. GlidDuration is stored as DateTime                                                    |
## setDisplayValue
 Sets the display value                                                                                                                 |
## setValue
 Sets the internal value of the GlideDuration object. Internally, GlidDuration is stored as DateTime                                    |
