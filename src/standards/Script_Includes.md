title: Script Include Standards

# Script Include Standards
* Generally speaking, create new script includes for individual applications, catalogs items, or functions.
    - As opposed to one script include for several catalog items, which may cause problems with delegated develpment.
* Only return information that the calling script will need
* Use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse instead of JSON.encode and JSON.decode
* Use Script Includes instead of Global Business Rules
* Use existing script includes when possible
* Avoid hardcoding values by using System Properties and Messages
* Remove logging and temporary comments before moving to production.
* Copy out-of-box script includes and edit the copy instead of editing the original.
