# Update Sets 

### Update Set Naming Conventions 

Use a consistent naming convention for update sets. 

* **NEVER COMPLETE THE DEFAULT UPDATE SET FOR GLOBAL**
* Create at least one local update set and switch from the Global update set to the local one before beginning work.  
* At a minimum, update sets must have a unique name that identifies the originating campus organization, concise description, and implementation sequence. A reference to the project requirement is also recommended to ensure traceability to customer requirements such as:  
org_reference_desc_seq/date 
  + org: Primary developer organizational acronym  
  + reference: External reference number  
  + desc: Short description  
  + seq/date: (optional) Sequence number or version or date 
  + Example: IET STRY0001234 Incident Hotfix 3 2020.01.12 
* The standard date format is YYYY. MM. DD. 
* Do not use the word “default” anywhere in your update set name 

### Good Practices for Update Sets 

 
* Never delete an Update Set. 
* Never re-open previously completed update sets. Create new ones instead. 
* Never manually merge update sets. Utilize batch functionality instead. 
* Before completing an update set, review the update set to ensure that the only updates included pertain to the desired work. 
* Preview update sets before committing them. 
* Identify dependencies between update sets. Follow naming conventions standards to specify the correct order for migrating them to the next instance. 
* Remove all debugging scripts and system properties before marking an update set as Complete. 
* In the dev instance, completed update sets should never be placed into a batch after it has been completed 
* Do not transfer updates between update sets manually. Seek administrative assistance when update sets contain incorrect updates. 
* Test your work before you complete your update set. 

### Instance Administrators

* When preparing for production release, batch all updates for that release together
* When pulling to production, delete all irrelevant update sets from the loaded table
