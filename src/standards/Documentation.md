# Documentation Standards
* For scripts
    - Comment code as if the original author will not be around anymore
    - Comment on functions with full parameter and return descriptions
* For others
    - Determine if a KB article is necessary
    - Otherwise provide a good description in the description field
* Keep comments/documentation as accurate and updated as possible
* Ensure documentation is well-written, clear, and meaningful
* Do not be verbose and unnecessary with your comments. For example, commenting about initializing a `GlideRecord` or variable.
