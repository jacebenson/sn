# Service Portal Standards

Aka Widgets, Pages, and the front-end.

### Portals

* New portals should be vetted by the TAG or IET Service Management as they may be granting access or read access to items/records that are not intended for the public
* Follow campus design standards (eg. common footer, color schemes, font-families, etc.)

### Widgets

* Do not display restricted information unless the user is logged in and is supposed to be able to see such information.
* Design widgets to be re-usable
* Do not edit other application widgets without permission
* Copy out-of-box widgets and edit the copy instead of editing the original.
* Be aware of how many libraries you import as it can impact performance.

### Pages

* If using role restrictions, evoke CAS for users not logged in first.
